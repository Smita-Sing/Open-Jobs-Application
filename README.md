# Open-Jobs-Application

“Open-Jobs” is an open job listing app for posting jobs instantly where users can post job openings as well as they can view the posted ones. 
It is an application which connects employers and job seekers.

The portal has a form for posting jobs by the recruiter/employer that will ask job details like job title /job type /company name /company URL /location /job link /job description /skills required.

The posted jobs are saved and fetched from the Cloud Firestore database in the form of job cards on UI.

Latest jobs catalog will be listed on the front page based on the job-posted date.

Job seekers can search and browse jobs by category i.e. Customized Search using filters provided, like –

Filter by job type - Full Time, Part Time or Contractual.

Filter by job location - Remote (WFH) jobs or In - Office Jobs. 

Job seekers can view the job titles with company name and skills required etc. for the listed jobs. They can also check further job details and will be able to apply.
